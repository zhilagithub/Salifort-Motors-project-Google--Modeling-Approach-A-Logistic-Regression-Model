Employee Retention Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to predict employee attrition at Salifort Motors using data provided by the HR department. By analyzing employee data, the goal is to identify key factors that contribute to employees leaving the company. A predictive model is built to forecast whether an employee is likely to leave, helping the company take proactive measures to improve employee satisfaction and retention.

Problem Statement

The HR department at Salifort Motors collected data on employee characteristics, but they need help understanding what factors are driving employee turnover. As a data analytics professional, you are tasked with analyzing this data and building a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company. By identifying employees at risk of quitting, the company can focus efforts on improving retention, which can save significant time and resources.

Objectives

Analyze the HR data to understand key factors affecting employee attrition.
Build a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) to predict employee retention.
Provide data-driven insights to the HR department on how to improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.
Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used to build the predictive model.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization libraries for creating plots and charts.
Jupyter Notebooks: Used for running the code in an interactive environment.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various employee attributes such as:

satisfaction_level
last_evaluation
number_project
average_montly_hours
tenure
Work_accident
left (target variable: 1 if the employee left, 0 if the employee stayed)
promotion_last_5years
Department
salary
The dataset was analyzed and cleaned, with feature engineering applied to transform and prepare the data for building the model.
